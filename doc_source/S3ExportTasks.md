# Export Log Data to Amazon S3 Using the AWS CLI<a name="S3ExportTasks"></a>

In the following example, you use an export task to export all data from a CloudWatch Logs log group named `my-log-group` to an Amazon S3 bucket named `my-exported-logs`\. This example assumes that you have already created a log group called `my-log-group`\.

## Step 1: Create an Amazon S3 Bucket<a name="CreateS3Bucket"></a>

We recommend that you use a bucket that was created specifically for CloudWatch Logs\. However, if you want to use an existing bucket, you can skip to step 2\.

**Note**  
The Amazon S3 bucket must reside in the same Region as the log data to export\. CloudWatch Logs doesn't support exporting data to Amazon S3 buckets in a different Region\.

**To create an Amazon S3 bucket using the AWS CLI**  
At a command prompt, run the following [create\-bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3api/create-bucket.html) command, where `LocationConstraint` is the Region where you are exporting log data\.

```
aws s3api create-bucket --bucket my-exported-logs --create-bucket-configuration LocationConstraint=us-east-2
```

The following is example output\.

```
{
    "Location": "/my-exported-logs"
}
```

## Step 2: Create an IAM User with Full Access to Amazon S3 and CloudWatch Logs<a name="CreateIAMUser-With-S3-Access-CLI"></a>

In the following steps, you create the IAM user with necessary permissions\.

**To create the user and assign permissions**

1. Create the IAM user by entering the following command\.

   ```
   aws iam create-user --user-name CWLExportUser
   ```

1. Attach the IAM managed policies to the IAM user that you just created\.

   ```
   export S3POLICYARN=$(aws iam list-policies --query 'Policies[?PolicyName==`AmazonS3FullAccess`].{ARN:Arn}' --output text)
   ```

   ```
   export CWLPOLICYARN=$( aws iam list-policies --query 'Policies[?PolicyName==`CloudWatchLogsFullAccess`].{ARN:Arn}' --output text)
   ```

   ```
   aws iam attach-user-policy --user-name CWLExportUser --policy-arn $S3POLICYARN
   ```

   ```
   aws iam attach-user-policy --user-name CWLExportUser --policy-arn $CWLPOLICYARN
   ```

1. Confirm that the two managed policies are attached\.

   ```
   aws iam list-attached-user-policies --user-name CWLExportUser
   ```

1. Configure your AWS CLI to include the IAM credentials of the *CWLExportUser* IAM user\. For more information, see [Configuring the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html)\.

## Step 3: Set Permissions on an Amazon S3 Bucket<a name="S3Permissions"></a>

By default, all Amazon S3 buckets and objects are private\. Only the resource owner, the account that created the bucket, can access the bucket and any objects that it contains\. However, the resource owner can choose to grant access permissions to other resources and users by writing an access policy\.

**To set permissions on an Amazon S3 bucket**

1. Create a file named `policy.json` and add the following access policy, changing `Resource` to the name of your S3 bucket and `Principal` to the endpoint of the Region where you are exporting log data\. Use a text editor to create this policy file\. Don't use the IAM console\.
   + If the bucket is in your account, use the following policy\. 

     ```
     {
         "Version": "2012-10-17",
         "Statement": [
             {
                 "Action": "s3:GetBucketAcl",
                 "Effect": "Allow",
                 "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-exported-logs",
                 "Principal": { "Service": "logs.us-west-2.amazonaws.com" }
             },
             {
                 "Action": "s3:PutObject" ,
                 "Effect": "Allow",
                 "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-exported-logs/*",
                 "Condition": { "StringEquals": { "s3:x-amz-acl": "bucket-owner-full-control" } },
                 "Principal": { "Service": "logs.us-west-2.amazonaws.com" }
             }
         ]
     }
     ```
   + If the bucket is in a different account, use the following policy instead\. It includes an additional statement using the IAM user you created in the previous step\.

     ```
     {
         "Version": "2012-10-17",
         "Statement": [
           {
               "Action": "s3:GetBucketAcl",
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-exported-logs",
               "Principal": { "Service": "logs.us-west-2.amazonaws.com" }
           },
           {
               "Action": "s3:PutObject" ,
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-exported-logs/random-string/*",
               "Condition": { "StringEquals": { "s3:x-amz-acl": "bucket-owner-full-control" } },
               "Principal": { "Service": "logs.us-west-2.amazonaws.com" }
           },
           {
               "Action": "s3:PutObject" ,
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-exported-logs/random-string/*",
               "Condition": { "StringEquals": { "s3:x-amz-acl": "bucket-owner-full-control" } },
               "Principal": { "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::SendingAccountID:user/CWLExportUser" }
           }
         ]
     }
     ```
   + If the bucket is in a different account, and you are using an IAM role instead of an IAM user, use the following policy instead\.

     ```
     {
         "Version": "2012-10-17",
         "Statement": [
           {
               "Action": "s3:GetBucketAcl",
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-exported-logs",
               "Principal": { "Service": "logs.us-west-2.amazonaws.com" }
           },
           {
               "Action": "s3:PutObject" ,
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-exported-logs/random-string/*",
               "Condition": { "StringEquals": { "s3:x-amz-acl": "bucket-owner-full-control" } },
               "Principal": { "Service": "logs.us-west-2.amazonaws.com" }
           },
           {
               "Action": [
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:PutObjectAcl"
               ],
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-exported-logs/random-string/*",
               "Condition": { "StringEquals": { "s3:x-amz-acl": "bucket-owner-full-control" } },
               "Principal": { "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::SendingAccountID:role/CWLExportUser" }
           }
         ]
     }
     ```

1. Set the policy that you just added as the access policy on your bucket by using the [put\-bucket\-policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3api/put-bucket-policy.html) command\. This policy enables CloudWatch Logs to export log data to your Amazon S3 bucket\. The bucket owner will have full permissions on all of the exported objects\.

   ```
   aws s3api put-bucket-policy --bucket my-exported-logs --policy file://policy.json
   ```
**Warning**  
If the existing bucket already has one or more policies attached to it, add the statements for CloudWatch Logs access to that policy or policies\. We recommend that you evaluate the resulting set of permissions to be sure that they're appropriate for the users who will access the bucket\.

## Step 4: Create an Export Task<a name="CreateExportTask"></a>

After you create the export task for exporting logs from a log group, the export task might take anywhere from a few seconds to a few hours, depending on the size of the data to export\.

**To create an export task using the AWS CLI**  
At a command prompt, use the following [create\-export\-task](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/logs/create-export-task.html) command to create the export task\.

```
aws logs create-export-task --profile CWLExportUser --task-name "my-log-group-09-10-2015" --log-group-name "my-log-group" --from 1441490400000 --to 1441494000000 --destination "my-exported-logs" --destination-prefix "export-task-output"
```

The following is example output\.

```
{
    "taskId": "cda45419-90ea-4db5-9833-aade86253e66"
}
```

## Step 5: Describe Export Tasks<a name="DescribeExportTasks"></a>

After you create an export task, you can get the current status of the task\.

**To describe export tasks using the AWS CLI**  
At a command prompt, use the following [describe\-export\-tasks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/logs/describe-export-tasks.html) command\.

```
aws logs --profile CWLExportUser describe-export-tasks --task-id "cda45419-90ea-4db5-9833-aade86253e66"
```

The following is example output\.

```
{
   "exportTasks": [
   {
      "destination": "my-exported-logs",
      "destinationPrefix": "export-task-output",
      "executionInfo": {
         "creationTime": 1441495400000
      },
      "from": 1441490400000,
      "logGroupName": "my-log-group",
      "status": {
         "code": "RUNNING",
         "message": "Started Successfully"
      },
      "taskId": "cda45419-90ea-4db5-9833-aade86253e66",
      "taskName": "my-log-group-09-10-2015",
      "tTo": 1441494000000
   }]
}
```

You can use the `describe-export-tasks` command in three different ways:
+ Without any filters: Lists all of your export tasks, in reverse order of creation\.
+ Filter on task ID: Lists the export task, if one exists, with the specified ID\.
+ Filter on task status: Lists the export tasks with the specified status\.

For example, use the following command to filter on the `FAILED` status\.

```
aws logs --profile CWLExportUser describe-export-tasks --status-code "FAILED"
```

The following is example output\.

```
{
   "exportTasks": [
   {
      "destination": "my-exported-logs",
      "destinationPrefix": "export-task-output",
      "executionInfo": {
         "completionTime": 1441498600000
         "creationTime": 1441495400000
      },
      "from": 1441490400000,
      "logGroupName": "my-log-group",
      "status": {
         "code": "FAILED",
         "message": "FAILED"
      },
      "taskId": "cda45419-90ea-4db5-9833-aade86253e66",
      "taskName": "my-log-group-09-10-2015",
      "to": 1441494000000
   }]
}
```

## Step 6: Cancel an Export Task<a name="CancelExportTask"></a>

You can cancel an export task if it is in either the `PENDING` or the `RUNNING` state\.

**To cancel an export task using the AWS CLI**  
At a command prompt, use the following [cancel\-export\-task](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/logs/cancel-export-task.html) command:

```
aws logs --profile CWLExportUser cancel-export-task --task-id "cda45419-90ea-4db5-9833-aade86253e66"
```

You can use the [describe\-export\-tasks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/logs/describe-export-tasks.html) command to verify that the task was canceled successfully\.
