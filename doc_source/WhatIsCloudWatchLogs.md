# What is Amazon CloudWatch Logs?<a name="WhatIsCloudWatchLogs"></a>

You can use Amazon CloudWatch Logs to monitor, store, and access your log files from Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud \(Amazon EC2\) instances, AWS CloudTrail, Route 53, and other sources\.

CloudWatch Logs enables you to centralize the logs from all of your systems, applications, and AWS services that you use, in a single, highly scalable service\. You can then easily view them, search them for specific error codes or patterns, filter them based on specific fields, or archive them securely for future analysis\. CloudWatch Logs enables you to see all of your logs, regardless of their source, as a single and consistent flow of events ordered by time, and you can query them and sort them based on other dimensions, group them by specific fields, create custom computations with a powerful query language, and visualize log data in dashboards\.

## Features<a name="cloudwatch-logs-features"></a>
+ **Query your log data** – You can use CloudWatch Logs Insights to interactively search and analyze your log data\. You can perform queries to help you more efficiently and effectively respond to operational issues\. CloudWatch Logs Insights includes a purpose\-built query language with a few simple but powerful commands\. We provide sample queries, command descriptions, query autocompletion, and log field discovery to help you get started\. Sample queries are included for several types of AWS service logs\. To get started, see [Analyzing log data with CloudWatch Logs Insights](AnalyzingLogData.md)\.
+ **Monitor logs from Amazon EC2 instances** – You can use CloudWatch Logs to monitor applications and systems using log data\. For example, CloudWatch Logs can track the number of errors that occur in your application logs and send you a notification whenever the rate of errors exceeds a threshold you specify\. CloudWatch Logs uses your log data for monitoring; so, no code changes are required\. For example, you can monitor application logs for specific literal terms \(such as "NullReferenceException"\) or count the number of occurrences of a literal term at a particular position in log data \(such as "404" status codes in an Apache access log\)\. When the term you are searching for is found, CloudWatch Logs reports the data to a CloudWatch metric that you specify\. Log data is encrypted while in transit and while it is at rest\. To get started, see [Getting started with CloudWatch Logs](CWL_GettingStarted.md)\.
+ **Monitor AWS CloudTrail logged events** – You can create alarms in CloudWatch and receive notifications of particular API activity as captured by CloudTrail and use the notification to perform troubleshooting\. To get started, see [Sending CloudTrail Events to CloudWatch Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cw_send_ct_events.html) in the *AWS CloudTrail User Guide*\.
+ **Log retention** – By default, logs are kept indefinitely and never expire\. You can adjust the retention policy for each log group, keeping the indefinite retention, or choosing a retention period between 10 years and one day\.
+ **Archive log data** – You can use CloudWatch Logs to store your log data in highly durable storage\. The CloudWatch Logs agent makes it easy to quickly send both rotated and non\-rotated log data off of a host and into the log service\. You can then access the raw log data when you need it\.
+ **Log Route 53 DNS queries** – You can use CloudWatch Logs to log information about the DNS queries that Route 53 receives\. For more information, see [Logging DNS Queries](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/query-logs.html) in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide*\.

## Related AWS services<a name="related_services_cwl"></a>

The following services are used in conjunction with CloudWatch Logs:
+ **AWS CloudTrail** is a web service that enables you to monitor the calls made to the CloudWatch Logs API for your account, including calls made by the AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface \(AWS CLI\), and other services\. When CloudTrail logging is turned on, CloudTrail captures API calls in your account and delivers the log files to the Amazon S3 bucket that you specify\. Each log file can contain one or more records, depending on how many actions must be performed to satisfy a request\. For more information about AWS CloudTrail, see [What Is AWS CloudTrail?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/whatisawscloudtrail.html) in the *AWS CloudTrail User Guide*\. For an example of the type of data that CloudWatch writes into CloudTrail log files, see [Logging Amazon CloudWatch Logs API calls in AWS CloudTrail](logging_cw_api_calls_cwl.md)\.
+ **AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\)** is a web service that helps you securely control access to AWS resources for your users\. Use IAM to control who can use your AWS resources \(authentication\) and what resources they can use in which ways \(authorization\)\. For more information, see [What Is IAM?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/introduction.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\.
+ **Amazon Kinesis Data Streams** is a web service you can use for rapid and continuous data intake and aggregation\. The type of data used includes IT infrastructure log data, application logs, social media, market data feeds, and web clickstream data\. Because the response time for the data intake and processing is in real time, processing is typically lightweight\. For more information, see [What is Amazon Kinesis Data Streams?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/introduction.html) in the *Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide*\.
+ **AWS Lambda** is a web service you can use to build applications that respond quickly to new information\. Upload your application code as Lambda functions and Lambda runs your code on high\-availability compute infrastructure and performs all the administration of the compute resources, including server and operating system maintenance, capacity provisioning and automatic scaling, code and security patch deployment, and code monitoring and logging\. All you need to do is supply your code in one of the languages that Lambda supports\. For more information, see [What is AWS Lambda?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/welcome.html) in the *AWS Lambda Developer Guide*\.
